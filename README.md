**Note: updated for version 1.15 on 27 September 2022**

This version of Istio *should* support Apple M1 processors, your feedback will be very much appreciated on this.

For support, please visit the support service on the platform you're following the course on (Udemy or VPP). I generally check every day.

Now available at VirtualPairProgrammers.com and Udemy!

Aim: make Istio understandable - it's not that hard. I don't mention TCP/IP stack levels once. Or the CNCF.

There will be further material added later [I'm working on this, but in slower time!]
